Stories of implementation:<br>
- As a driver, you want to post specific details about your car/travel
- As a rider, you want to be able to easily find a car that you're comfortable with, and also have a close enough destination.
- As a driver, we could store old rides in a ride history so that riders can later see someone's ride history.

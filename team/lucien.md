Hi, my name is Lucien Luc. 
I'm a third year Computer Science Major from Thousand Oaks, California. 
Some ideas for this project would be to use Google OAuth to create accounts per person. Each account would have
the ability to select whether they want to make a rideshare or search for rideshares. If they are making a
rideshare, they would select the time leaving and where they are going. Users would be able to query and find
rideshares based on time and destination. We could probably use Google Maps API to display this information.

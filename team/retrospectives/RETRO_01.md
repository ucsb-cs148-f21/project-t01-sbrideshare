# Date of Retrospective: 10/13/21

* Led by: Heather Dinh
* Present: Lucien Luc, Robert Gee, Louie Aldana, Chris Stasiowski
* Absent: n/a

## Action item

* a goal: more organization with files and directories, make sure that the master branch is clean; getting better with using Github and VSCode
* a change: emphasize the review of pull requests before merging changes to master; notify on Slack the other members so that we know that there is a PR to review
* a measurement: a way to measure that our Slack communication has sped up the process to push changes to master is to check up during SCRUM meetings to make sure there aren't any pending PRs; in this case, there should be less pending PRs since they would be taken care of outside of class

## Retro Assessment

A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.

* For this retrospective, I used the Start/Stop/Continue outline, and a Trello board as an artifact to actively document what went well
and what did not go well in the past few weeks.

A brief assessment of how it went.
* It went well, we got through the retrospective efficiently using the Start/Stop/Continue template and each member was able to voice their opinions and provide input. In addition, the Trello board was a good visual component.

What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?
* Based on what I learned today, I think that the Start/Stop/Continue template works well with the Trello board, and is an effective way to 
run a retrospective. However, it would also be interesting to see another format for the next retrospective.

## Retro Assessment

A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.

* For this retrospective, we used the Start/Stop/Continue outline, and a Trello board as an artifact to actively document what went well and what did not go well in the past few weeks. This opportunity gave us further direction after a brief MVP celebration 

A brief assessment of how it went.
* It went well, each team member added their inputs to the Trello cards and we had discussion based off of everyones feedback and MVP presentation. We got through the retrospective efficiently using the Start/Stop/Continue template. The Trello board was a good visual component that will be useful throughout the project. 

What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?
* Start/Stop/Continue template works well with the Trello board; provides great visualization and effective procedure for the retrospective.

## Outcomes

* SBRideSHare web application is coming together nicely. We received praise and encouragment from leadership. We will continue to improve our web application and adjust the UI. MVP was a success; now team SBRideShare can add extra features to make the design really stand out.

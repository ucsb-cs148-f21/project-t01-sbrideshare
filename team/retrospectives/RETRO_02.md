## Action item

- a goal: We did good work on the MVP! Sprint planning was great; planned out upcoming weeks were followed thru and successful
- a change: We wish to have more team members looking at pull requests & adding more issues. Also, closing issues once complete is important
- a measurement: There are less issues that are completed still open

## Retro Assessment

A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.

- For this retrospective, we used the Start/Stop/Continue outline, and a Trello board as an artifact to actively document what went well and what did not go well in the past few weeks. This opportunity gave us further direction after a brief MVP celebration

A brief assessment of how it went.

- It went well, each team member added their inputs to the Trello cards and we had discussion based off of everyones feedback and MVP presentation. We got through the retrospective efficiently using the Start/Stop/Continue template. The Trello board was a good visual component that will be useful throughout the project.

What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
based on what you learned today?

- Start/Stop/Continue template works well with the Trello board; provides great visualization and effective procedure for the retrospective.

## Outcomes

- SBRideSHare web application is coming together nicely. We received praise and encouragment from leadership. We will continue to improve our web application and adjust the UI. MVP was a success; now team SBRideShare can add extra features to make the design really stand out.

## Retro Outcome Assessment

A brief description of what your retro 2 experiment was:

- For this experiment, we used a Start/Stop/Continue outline. As a group, we contributed a series of cards that included goals, changes, and measurements that we used to plan accordingly. A Trello board came in handy to accomplish our goals for RETRO_02.

A brief recap of the metric you planned on using:

- We rely on our daily scrum meetings and sprint retrospectives to keep us on track to meet goals all while maintaining excellent communication within our team.

The outcome according to the metric now that the next Sprint is done (maybe already for a while).

- As we approach week 9, our goals remain the same. Stay on top on current goals as we shift our attention towards RETRO_03 and focus on documention and current issues related to our project.

Your conclusions based on this outcome. You can decide to cement this change going forward, to modify it (start a new experiment), or to discard it and go back to previous procedures.

- The Start/Stop/Continue outline works well. Chances are we might stick with it. This is something we may modify, however, that information is yet to be determined within the coming days.

## Optional
* How to design our app? Colors/fonts/images.
* How are we going to deal with API keys for Google with the reviewing team? Make them add a credit card.

## Retro Assessment

* We used the retro outline of Start, Stop, Continue to show which behaviors and tasks are good, need improvement, and need to stop.
* The retro went well. We got together and identified the things we needed to get done, especially all the documentation and manuals we needed to create. We identified some features we wanted to input and divided up some more work.
* At the beginning, the retros were useful to come together and identify team behaviors that we wanted to change for the rest of the quarter. By this retro, however, it seems that a lot of what we are doing seems to be on track and working for everyone.

# Learning Plan

## Our current tech stack for SBRideShare
 - MongoDB
 - Express
 - React
 - NodeJS
 - Github
 - Heroku
 - Google OAuth

## Existing strengths
A brief rundown of the technologies that each team member if familiar with.

 - Chris: React, Github, Heroku, GoogleOAuth
 - Heather: React, NodeJS, Github, Heroku, Google OAuth
 - Louie: React, Express, NodeJS, Github, Heroku
 - Lucien: MERN, Github, Heroku
 - Robert: Github, Heroku

## Where to develop knowledge
Technologies and language that the team needs to become more familiar with to effectively contribute to the project.

 - As a team, each person is familiar with Github and Heroku. To effectively contribute, the team needs to focus on learning how the MERN stack works, and an overview of how frontend and backend are created/connected.

## Specific commitments to learn these technologies
A plan for each member to get familiarized with the tech that will be used.

 - Chris: Find sample projects and examples to experiment with Google OAuth (week 3), read documentation for MERN stack(week 4)
 - Heather: Read documentation for React (week 3), research more libraries that we can include for React (week 4)
 - Louie: Youtube and read documentation for React (week 3), and learn about Github (week 4)
 - Lucien: Look at code and read documentation for MongoDB (week 3), and React frontend libraries (week 4)
 - Robert: Watch tutorials to learn more about working with Express and React (week 3 and 4)

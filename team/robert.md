Hi, I'm Robert. I'm a third year CS major from Los Altos, California. 
My favorite thing to do outside of school is play volleyball.<br>
Some ideas that I have for this project:<br>
Better ride searching for passengers - Can search for rides based on drive proximity to passenger's desired leave time/end destination.<br>
Driver/passenger rating - Can rate drivers and passengers so that others know if someone is a good/bad drivers or good/bad passenger.<br>
Car Identification - If the driver wants, they can include a picture of their car to their profile so that passengers can be sure that they are getting into the right car.

Lucien:
Most of my work on this app was setting up the backend. 

- Wrote nearly all of the backend API's for frontend client to call which handles business logic for our application.
- Wrote tests for most API's (stopped writing tests later on because didn't want to spam our Google API since we have a credit card on it)
- Organized how our database should be structured. Tried to implement a RESTful API.
- Did some work on Search bar on the "Find a Ride page". Mostly regarding the inputs and making sure it retrieves the right rides.

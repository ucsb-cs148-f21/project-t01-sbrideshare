Chris:

For this project, most of my work involved setup and maintenance of our Google client and APIs, along with documentation.

- I created a basic frontend React template for us to start from and made sure that all my teammates were able to setup and use the code on their local machines.
- I setup the use of Google OAuth for our application to allow users to login using their Google accounts and gain information from that.
- I designed certain aspects of our frontend that was built off of later, including a search bar and landing page.
- I was in charge of setting up the APIs that our application uses, along with the permissions and keys that come with it.
- I was in charge of writing the design and deployment documents for our lab assignments.
- I also helped others debug their issues whenever something came up.

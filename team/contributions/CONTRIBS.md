### Chris

For this project, most of my work involved setup and maintenance of our Google client and APIs, along with documentation.

- I created a basic frontend React template for us to start from and made sure that all my teammates were able to setup and use the code on their local machines.
- I setup the use of Google OAuth for our application to allow users to login using their Google accounts and gain information from that.
- I designed certain aspects of our frontend that was built off of later, including a search bar and landing page.
- I was in charge of setting up the APIs that our application uses, along with the permissions and keys that come with it.
- I was in charge of writing the design and deployment documents for our lab assignments.
- I also helped others debug their issues whenever something came up.

### Heather
Most of my work in the group was focused on frontend. In the scope of the entire application, I worked on implementing multiple functionalities such as:
 - Login page
    - front page graphics and font styles
    - "Get Started" button that toggles pagination component from front splashpage to Google login
    - functionality to automatically display the Login page when user is not logged in
 - Home page
    - Carousel component that automatically cycles through Ride and Drive banner
    - Custom css to center carousel and include user-interactive tabs
 - Navbar
    - dark theme styling, React bootstrap and custom css
    - passing props through components to set active/highlighted Navbar tab
 - UI testing
    - frontend testing suite using react testing library
    - rendered components with Jest mocked data to make sure props pass correctly
    - tested functionalities of some button presses
 - general UI
    - worked with both MaterialUI and React Bootstrap APIs
    - background gradient theme
    - created a Figma wireframe/layout that outlines what UI should look like
 - backend
    - created API to submit a user to the "user" table in the MongoDB database
    - implemented tests for querying users in database

### Louie
Most of my work on this app was setting up the Rides form.

- Ride form
  -calendar
  -Google Address auto-complete
  -pricing
  -availability
  -slider bar/traveling distance,etc
  -contact information.

- CSS styling for the Rides form

- Created our MVP demo/video

### Lucien
Most of my work on this app was setting up the backend. 

- Wrote nearly all of the backend API's for frontend client to call which handles business logic for our application.
- Wrote tests for most API's (stopped writing tests later on because didn't want to spam our Google API since we have a credit card on it)
- Organized how our database should be structured. Tried to implement a RESTful API.
- Did some work on Search bar on the "Find a Ride page". Mostly regarding the inputs and making sure it retrieves the right rides. 

### Robert
I did most of my work on the frontend portion of the project. 

In terms of coding, I pretty much solely worked on stuff relating to the Find a Ride page.
- Functionalities such as: signing up for a ride, leaving a ride, adding rider pickup locations
	popups on button presses, collapsing the search bar, additional information expanding area
- Communication between frontend and backend: sending details mentioned above to the database,
	helping to debug backend when I ran into issues with it
- All of the css for the Find a Ride and My Rides page (except for the background gradient, that was Heather)
- Designed the layout for both the Find a Ride and My Rides page

Other then just coding, I also helped to brainstorm ideas of what direction we should be taking the project
in to improve it, such as the layout of other pages, the idea for the background gradient, and information that
would be helpful to have as a driver/rider (contact info, pickup locations)

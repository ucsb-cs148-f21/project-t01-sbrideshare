Robert:
I did most of my work on the frontend portion of the project. 

In terms of coding, I pretty much solely worked on stuff relating to the Find a Ride page.
- Functionalities such as: signing up for a ride, leaving a ride, adding rider pickup locations
	popups on button presses, collapsing the search bar, additional information expanding area
- Communication between frontend and backend: sending details mentioned above to the database,
	helping to debug backend when I ran into issues with it
- All of the css for the Find a Ride and My Rides page (except for the background gradient, that was Heather)

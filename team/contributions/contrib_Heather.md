Most of my work in the group was focused on frontend. In the scope of the entire application, I worked on implementing multiple functionalities such as:
 - Login page
    - front page graphics and font styles
    - "Get Started" button that toggles pagination component from front splashpage to Google login
    - functionality to automatically display the Login page when user is not logged in
 - Home page
    - Carousel component that automatically cycles through Ride and Drive banner
    - Custom css to center carousel and include user-interactive tabs
 - Navbar
    - dark theme styling, React bootstrap and custom css
    - passing props through components to set active/highlighted Navbar tab
 - UI testing
    - frontend testing suite using react testing library
    - rendered components with Jest mocked data to make sure props pass correctly
    - tested functionalities of some button presses
 - general UI
    - worked with both MaterialUI and React Bootstrap APIs
    - background gradient theme
    - created a Figma wireframe/layout that outlines what UI should look like

Hi!
I am Chris and a third year Computer Science student at UC Santa Barbara!
For this project, I was thinking of having two tabs available after the user logs in: one for driving and one for riding.
For riding, the user can search for rides to their desired location and within a desired time frame.
For driving, the user can post their drive with basic information like how many seats are available, storage capacity, destination, etc.

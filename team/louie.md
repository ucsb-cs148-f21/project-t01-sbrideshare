Hi everyone. My name is Louie and i'm a fourth year CS student. I enjoy spending time with my wife & son. Family and school keep me busy!


--project ideas--

• real-time tracking: upon sucessful completion on RideShare request, customer can view the drivers location and ETA.

• driver and passenger information: current passenger/driver details are provided to offer sense of security. Perhaps a good driver/passenger point system that rewards driver/passengers -- bragging rights!  :)

• notifications: alerts passenger of ride details at the start/end of trip (fare detail/charges).

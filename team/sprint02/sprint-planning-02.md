Sprint Planning Meeting

## Sprint Goal

The main purpose of this sprint meeting was to lay the ground work and prepare for our team MVP. Overall, we came to an agreement on a prioritzed list of user stories and what will be delivered by the end of sprint02. 

We populated our project with a list of TODOs and backlog cards. The list of TODOs were tagged with issues/ team members assigned. Meanwhile, we added the remaining cards to the backlog section for a future sprint.

Hi, I'm Heather and I'm a third year Computer Science!
For our UCSB rideshare app, I think that we should have users sign in through gmail, and use Google OAuth. This way users can choose to either drive or search for rides.
In addition, we can have a filtering system that users can use to specify information such as time or destination.
Since we're creating a web app, some technologies that we can utilize are React, Google Oauth, NodeJS, and Heroku.

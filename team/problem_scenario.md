Problem:<br>
- People are either going to want a ride or give other people rides.
- There is no ride sharing app that's dedicated to UCSB students and easy to navigate.

What we want to do:<br>
- Make a ridesharing page that's easier to navigate.
- Get rid of the long list of destinations.
- Give users a map of destinations using Google Maps API.
- Place markers showing where drivers are going.
- Give users specific details about a ride.

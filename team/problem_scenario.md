Problem:<br>
- People are either going to want a ride or give other people rides.
- There is no ride sharing app that's dedicated to UCSB students and easy to navigate.

What we want to do:<br>
- Make a ridesharing page that's easier to navigate.
- Get rid of the long list of destinations.
- Give users a map of destinations using Google Maps API.
- Place markers showing where drivers are going.
- Give users specific details about a ride.

Stories of implementation:<br>
- As a driver, you want to post specific details about your car/travel
- As a rider, you want to be able to easily find a car that you're comfortable with, and also have a close enough destination.
- As a driver, we could store old rides in a ride history so that riders can later see someone's ride history.
